    1. Our Father who in heaven art,
    Hallowed be thy name;
    Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
    In heav'n and earth the same.
    DOUBLE CHORUS.
    Come, my Saviour, 

    0 my Saviour,
    Come and bless thy people now,
    While at thy feet we humbly bow,

    0 come and save us now.
    Then will we sing our suff'rings o'er,
    And praise thee evermore;
    Then will we sing our suff'rings o'er,
    And praise thee evermore.

    2. Give us this day our daily bread;
    Our trespasses forgive;
    As we forgive our fellowâ€”men,
    May we thy grace receive.
    Come, my Saviour, &c.

    3. And in temptation leave us not;
    From evil us defend;
    For Thine, 

    0 Lord, the kingdom is,
    For ever, without end.
    Come, my Saviour, &c.

    4. Thine is the power, 

    0 Lord, to bring
    The kingdom down to men;
    Thine is the glory evermore,
    And kingdom without end.
    Come, my Saviour, &c.

    5. In that glad day shall all thy saints
    A joyful tribute bring,
    Of praise and power, of joy and song,
    To their exalted King.
    Come, my Saviour, &c.

    1. I'm a lonely trav'ller here,
    Weary, opprest;
    But my journey's end is near,
    Soon I shall rest.
    Dark and dreary is the way,
    Toiling I've come—
    Ask me not with you to stay—
    Yonder's my home.

    2. I'm a weary trav'ller here,
    I must go on,
    For my journey's end is near—
    I must be gone.
    Brighter joys than earth can give;
    Win me away;
    Pleasures, that for ever live—
    I cannot stay.

    3. I'm a trav'ller to a land
    Where all is fair;
    Where is seen no broken band—
    All, all are there;
    Where no tear shall ever fall,
    Nor heart be sad;
    Where the glory is for all,
    And all are glad.

    4. I'm a trav'ller, and I go
    Where all is fair;
    Farewell all I've lov'd below—
    I must be there.
    Worldly honors, hopes and gain,
    All I resign;
    Welcome sorrow, grief and pain.
    If heav'n be mine.

    5. I'm a trav'ller—call me not—
    Upward's my way;
    Yonder is my rest and lot,
    I cannot stay.
    Farewell earthly pleasures all,
    Pilgrim I'll roam,
    Hail me not—in vain you call—
    Yonder's my home.

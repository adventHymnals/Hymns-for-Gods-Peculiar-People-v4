    1. The last lovely morning
    All blooming and fair,
    Is fast onward fleeting,
    And soon will appear!
    While the mighty, mighty, mighty, trump
    Sounds “Come, come away!”
    O! let us be ready
    To hail the glad day.

    2. And when that bright morning
    In splendor shall dawn,
    Our tears will be ended,
    Our sorrows all gone.
    While the mighty. &c.

    3. The Bridegroom from glory
    To earth shall descend ;
    Ten thousand bright angels
    Around him attend.
    While the mighty, &c.

    4. The graves will be open'd,The dead will arise,
    And with the Redeemer
    Mount up to the skies.
    While the mighty, &c.

    5 The saints then immortal,
    In glory shall reign!
    The Bride with the Bridegroom
    Forever remain.
    While the mighty, &.c.

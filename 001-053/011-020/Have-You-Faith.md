[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d7zdwuD3u1bbwdQs2xRZkDHMmCS0J%2Dgt/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus our Saviour saysâ€”I will appear!
    Have you faith?
    My trumpet is sounding majestic and clear!
    Have you faith?
    The faithful alone I come to see,
    And they shall live and reign with me,
    Only have faith!

    2. Prophets have spoken, their words are fulfill'd,
    Have you faith?
    My word is establish'd, your anguish is still'd,
    Have you faith?
    The plan of salvation the faith's eye will see,
    And live for ever and reign with Me,
    Only have faith!

    3. Though I should tarry, be not dismay'd,
    Have you faith?
    The judgement is coming o'er all I've said,
    Have you faith?
    The doubt to the bondage, the faith, to the free,
    To live for ever and reign with me,
    Only have faith!

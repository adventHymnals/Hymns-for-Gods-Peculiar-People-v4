[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvyJKWzs_UvPu2g0KUMxa2IGcKY8GSis/edit?mode=html)



    1. Holy Bible! Book divine!
    Precious treasure, thou art mine
    Mine, to tell me whence I came;
    Mine, to teach one what I am;
    Mine, to chide me when I rove;
    Mine, to show a Saviour's love;
    Mine, art thou, to guide my feet;
    Mine to judge, condemn, acquit.

    2. Mine, to comfort in distress,
    If the Holy Spirit bless;
    Mine, to show, by living faith,
    Man can triumph over death;
    Mine, to tell of joys to come,
    And the rebel sinner's doom;

    0, thou precious book divine!
    Precious treasure, thou art mine.

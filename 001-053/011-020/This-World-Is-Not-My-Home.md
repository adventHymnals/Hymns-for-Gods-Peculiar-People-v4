    1. Farewell! farewell! to all below,
    My Jesus calls and I must go:
    I'll launch my boat upon the sea,
    This land is not the land for me.
    This world is not my home;
    This world is not my home;
    This world is all a wilderness;
    This world is not my home.

    2. I found the winding path of sin
    A rugged path to travel in;
    Beyond this fading world I see
    The land the Saviour bought for me.
    This world is not my home, &c.

    3. Farewell! my friends ! I'll not stay here—
    The home I seek will soon appear;
    Where Christ is not, I cannot be;
    This land is not the land for me.
    This world is not my home, &c.

    4. Praise be to God our hope's on high;
    The angels sing and so do I
    Where seraphs bow and bend the knee,

    0 that's the land—the land for me.
    This world is not my home, &c.

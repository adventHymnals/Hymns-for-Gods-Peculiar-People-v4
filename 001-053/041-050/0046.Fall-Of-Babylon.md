    1. Hail the day so long expected,
    Hail, the year of full release;
    Zion's walls are now erected,
    And her watchmen publish peace;
    Throughout Shiloh's wide dominion,
    Hear the trumpet loudly roar,
    Babylon is fallen, is fallen, is fallen,
    Babylon is fallen to rise no more.

    2. Come “my people” and forsake her,
    Cast away your slavish fears;
    Hear the voice from heaven proclaiming
    It's the end of all her years.
    Raise your voices she is fallen,
    Lift your banners up on high,Babylon is fallen, is fallen, is fallen, &c.

    3. Now her plagues are surely coming,
    And her merchants all shall mourn;
    All their merchandise shall fail them,
    And with fire it shall burn;
    Cry aloud, ye kings and nobles,
    Priests and people, rich and poor,
    Babylon is fallen, is fallen, is fallen, &c.

    4. Blow the trumpet in mount Zion,
    Christ will come the second time,
    Ruling with a rod of iron,
    All who now his foes combine
    Babel's garments we've rejected,
    And the wedge of golden ore;
    Babylon is fallen, is fallen, is fallen, &c.

    1. Lo, what a glorious sight appears,To our believing eyes;
    The earth and seas are pass'd away,
    And the old rolling skies.

    2. From the third heav'n where God resides,
    That holy, happy place;
    The New Jerusalem comes down,
    Adorn'd with shining grace.

    3. Attending angels shout for joy,
    And the bright armies sing,
    “Mortals behold the sacred seat
    Of your eternal King!”

    4. How long, dear Saviour, 

    0 how long
    Shall this bright hour delay?
    Fly swift around, ye wheels of time,
    And bring the welcome day.

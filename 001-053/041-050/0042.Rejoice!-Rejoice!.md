    1. Rejoice, rejoice, the promis'd time is coming,
    Rejoice, rejoice, the wilderness shall bloom;
    And Zion's children then shall sing,
    The deserts all are blossoming.
    Rejoice, rejoice, the promis'd time is coming,
    Rejoice, rejoice, the wilderness shall bloom;
    King Jesus' banner wide unfurl'd,
    Shall wave in triumph o'er the world,
    And every Christian bond or free,
    Shall hail the glorious jubilee.
    Rejoice, rejoice, the promis'd time is coming,
    Rejoice, rejoice, the wilderness shall bloom.

    2. Rejoice, rejoice, the promis'd time is coming,
    Rejoice, rejoice, the “PRINCE OF PEACE” shall reign;
    And lambs may with the leopard play,
    For nought shall harm in Zion's way.
    Rejoice, rejoice, the promis'd time is coming.
    Rejoice, rejoice, the “PRINCE OF PEACE” shall reign
    The sword and spear of needless worth,
    Shall find no place in the new earth,
    For Peace shall smile from shore to shore,
    And nations shall learn war no more.
    Rejoice, rejoice, the promis'd time is coming,
    Rejoice, rejoice, the “PRINCE of PEACE” shall reign.

    1. Bright crowns are just before us,
    Then onward let us sing,
    Jerusalem's bright seraphs ,
    Eâ€™en now are on the wing.

    2. King Jesus and his angels,
    Are hasting on their way,
    To gather all the weary
    Who faithful watch and pray.

    3. Toil on a little longer,
    Stand stiffly for the word,
    Oh ye, my fellow pilgrims,
    The lov'd ones of my Lord.

    4. The kingdom, is the watchword,
    We've almost reach'd our home,
    Oh, glory hallelujah!
    The Bride is saying Come.

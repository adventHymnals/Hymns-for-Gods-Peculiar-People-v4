[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fgc1aRD1iGownWi5nkmvhu7QKIAt%2DgLu/edit?mode=html)



    1. Thine earthly Sabbath, Lord, we love,
    But there's a nobler rest above;
    To that our laboring souls aspire,
    With ardent hope, and strong desire.

    2. No more fatigue, no more distress,
    No sin nor death can reach that place,
    No tears shall mingle with the songs
    That warble from immortal tongues.

    3. No rude alarm of raging foes,
    No cares to break their long repose,
    No midnight shade, no clouded sun,
    But sacred high eternal noon.

    4. 

    0 long expected day begin,
    Dawn on those realms of wo and sin;
    Fain would I leave this weary road,
    And go to meet my blessed Lord.

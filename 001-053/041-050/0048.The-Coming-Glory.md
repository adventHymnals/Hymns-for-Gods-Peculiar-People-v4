    1. I'm glad I know that Christ shall reign
    In glory, glory, glory;
    And come to earth in clouds again,
    In glory, glory, glory;
    'Tis glory's fortaste makes me sing,
    Of glory, glory, glory;
    And to my Saviour praises bringSing glory, glory, glory.

    2. I hope to see Him on the throne
    In glory, glory, glory;
    When He shall come to claim his own,
    In glory, glory, glory;
    I'll sing while mounting through the air,
    Of glory, glory, glory;
    To meet my Father's children there,
    In glory, glory, glory;

    3. Come on, dear friends, let's mend our pace,
    To glory, glory, glory;
    We soon shall see Him face to face,
    In glory, glory, glory.
    The Bride shall reign, the Bridegroom too,
    In glory, glory, glory;
    Let's keep the blessed prize in view,
    'Tis glory, glory, glory.

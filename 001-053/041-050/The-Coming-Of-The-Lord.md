    1. Hear the glorious proclamation,
    The glad tidings of salvation,
    Hear the glorious proclamation,
    Of the Saviour near.
    CHORUS.
    While the choir of angels,
    While the choir of angels,
    While the choir of angels,
    Shall be chanting through the sky.

    2. Hark! The tidings onward rolling,
    Jesus comes the world controlling!
    Hark! The tidings onward rolling,
    Jesus comes to reign.

    3. Suddenly a burst of thunder,
    And the concave parts asunder,
    Suddenly a burst of thunder,
    And the skies depart.

    4. See the ‘sign’ in heaven appearing,
    And the blazing chariot nearing.
    See the ‘sign’ in heaven appearing,
    And the Saviour there.

    5. See the earth in terror shaking,
    And the dead to life awaking,See the earth in terror shaking,
    And the saints arise.

    6. Now on wings of light ascending
    With a shining host attending,
    Now on wings of light ascending,
    See them mount the skies.

    7. See the banner waves in glory,
    While ten thousand tell the story,
    See the banner waves in glory,
    And the saints are there.

    8. They are sav'd from death for ever,
    Praise to him who did deliver,
    They are sav'd from death forever,
    And to die no, more.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1frDmTlSxO07VWAuDb0TKPyiQ9DXZTJAS/edit?mode=html)



    1. Hail, peaceful morn, thy dawn I hail,
    How do thy hours my mind regale
    With feasts of heavenly joy;
    Nor can I half Thy blessings name,
    Which kindle in my soul a flame,And all my powers employ.

    2. How shall I best improve thy hours?
    Lord on me shed in copious showers
    Thy Spirit, and Thy grace;
    That when thy sacred courts I tread,
    My soul may eat the heavenly bread.
    And sing Jehovah's praise.

    3. Thou hallow'd season of repose,
    Thou balm to soothe the throbbing woes,
    Of this care-stricken breast;
    Thy sacred hours I'll ever greet,
    And with the faithful will I meet,
    To taste Thy holy rest.

    4. Then to my chamber I'll repair,
    With awe to talk with God in pray'r,
    And all my griefs to tell;
    His kind compassion will relieve,
    His bounteous hand will mercies give,
    And with the contrite dwell.

    5. Thus may the Sabbath pass away,
    My best, my holiest, happiest day,
    The sweetest of the seven;
    But yet a rest for saints remains,
    A Sabbath free from ills and pains,
    Eternal, and in heaven.

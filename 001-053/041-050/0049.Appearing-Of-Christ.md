[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g5yxP2tcUy1bTFGVAs8pOyzP3ve0fNV6/edit?mode=html)



    1. The appearing of Christ is good,
    How good it is to me,
    'Tis unlike the tyrant's rod,
    His sceptre to see.
    Let thy kingdom come,
    Holy will on earth be done,
    Saints gather'd in one,
    When will it be?

    2. Our journey is to Canaan,
    We are almost there,
    The scoffs of the wicked then
    Will be heard by none:

    0 how glorious
    Are the promises for us,
    Jesus, Thee we'll trust,
    Conduct us home.

    3. I will look for that City, Lord,
    I'll look and adore,
    My longing eyes are turn'd toward.
    That bright blissful shore,
    Fruits immortal grow,
    Tree of life is precious too,
    My bark shall go through,
    I want no more.

    4. No eye hath ever seen the like,
    Of what we shall be,
    He'll clothe us in garments bright,
    How lovely to see.
    Spotless, white and pure,
    In the kingdom ever sure,
    Foes cannot allure
    How happy we.

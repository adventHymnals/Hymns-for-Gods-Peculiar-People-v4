[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fSAGMJRRT5f2sZgW4H9l0cIuJP7aoC%2DE/edit?mode=html)



    1. Come let us anew, our journey pursue,
    Roll round with the year;
    And never stand still, till the Master appear
    And never stand still, till the Master appear.

    2. His adoreable will let us gladly fulfill,
    And our talents improve,
    By the patience of hope and the labor of love.

    3. Our life as a dream, our time as a stream,
    Glides swiftly away,
    And the fugitive moment refuses to stay.

    4. The arrow is flown, the moment is gone;
    The millennial year
    Rushes on to our view, and eternity's here.

    5. 

    0 that each in the day of his coming may say,
    "I have fought my way through;
    I have finish'd the work thou didst give me to do."

    6. 

    0 that each from his Lord may receive the glad word
    â€œWell and faithfully done!
    Enter into my joy, and sit down on my throne."

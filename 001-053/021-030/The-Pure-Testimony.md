[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1evIyV2ugCivHBjNY0Gob%2DqqzBeyQRPuD/edit?mode=html)



    1. The pure testimony put forth in the Spirit,
    Cuts like a sharp two-edged sword,
    And hypocrites now are most sorely tormented,
    Because they're condemn'd by the word.
    The pure testimony discovers the dross,
    While wicked professors make light of the cross,
    And Babylon trembles for fear of her loss.

    2. Then blow ye the trumpet in pure testimony,
    And let the saints hear it again;

    0 come ye from Babylon, Egypt and Sodom,
    And make your way over the plain.
    Come, wash all your robes in the blood of the Lamb,
    And walk in the Spirit, as Jesus has done,
    In the pure testimony you will overcome.

    3. The world will not persecute those who are like them,
    But hold them the same as their own;
    The pure testimony cries out separation,Which calls you your lives to lay down;
    Come out from their spirit and practices too;
    The track of the Saviour keep full in your view,
    The pure testimony still cut its way through.

    4. A battle is coming between the two kingdoms,
    The armies are gathering round;
    The pure testimony and vile persecution,
    Will come to close battle ere long;
    Then gird on your armor ye saints of the Lord,
    And he will direct you by his living word;
    The pure testimony trill cut like a sword.

[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fC8hwCr1qgP0D5qEvUAEHvrUNmEjQD8i/edit?mode=html)



    1. The coming events of the kingdom of God,
    Cast in glory its shadows before;
    And my being would leap from its prison'd abode,
    And the King in his beauty adore.

    2. He comes, and the spirit that lingers below;
    In the hearts of the chosen and tried,
    Is quicken'd, and tells, in its mystical flow,
    The approach of the Bridegroom and Bride.

    3. The love, and the joy, and the peace of the blest,
    Like the day star, arise in the soul,
    And we taste the first fruits of the Eden of rest,
    And we hasten to enter the goal.

    4. All glory, all glory, to him that was slain,
    Who hath wash'd and redeem'd us to God ;
    For he cometh with power in his kingdom to reign,
    And the earth to his sceptre is bow'd.

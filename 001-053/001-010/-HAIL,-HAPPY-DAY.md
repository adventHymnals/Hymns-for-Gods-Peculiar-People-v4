    0 HAIL, HAPPY DAY.

    1. 

    0 hail, happy day, that speaks our trials ended,
    Our Lord has come to take us home;

    0 hail, happy day;
    No more by doubts or fears distress'd,
    We now shall gain our promis'd rest,
    And be for ever blest; 

    0 hail, happy day.

    2. Swell loud the glad note, our bondage now is over;
    The jubilee proclaims us free;

    0 hail, happy day;
    The day that brings a sweet release,
    That crowns our Jesus Prince
    And bids our sorrows cease;

    0 hail, happy day.

    3. 

    0 hail, happy day, 
    that ends our tears and sorrow,
    That brings us joy without alloy,

    0 hail, happy day
    There peace shall wave her scepter high
    And love's fair banner greet the eye,
    Proclaiming victory; 

    0 hail, happy day.

    4. We hail thy bright beams, 
    0 morn of Zion’s glory,
    Thy blessed light breaks on our sight,

    0 hail, happy day;
    Fair Beulah’s fields before us rise,
    And sweetly burst upon our eyes,
    The joys of Paradise; 

    0 hail happy day.

    5. Thrice hail, happy day, 
    when earth shall smile in gladness,
    And Eden bloom o'er nature’s tomb,

    0 hail, happy day;
    Where life's pellucid waters glide,
    Safe by the dear Redeemer's side,
    For ever we'll abide; 

    0 hail, happy day.

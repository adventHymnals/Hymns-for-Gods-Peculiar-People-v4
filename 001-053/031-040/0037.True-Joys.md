[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dr96jg8brKyrZ6fqLyp7UqxVPDcSIl7C/edit?mode=html)



    1. O tell me no more
    Of this world's vain store,
    The time for such trifles
    With me now is o'er.

    2. A city I've found
    Where true joys abound;
    To dwell I'm determin'd
    On this happy ground.

    3. My soul, don't delay,
    He calls thee away;
    Rise, follow thy Saviour,
    And bless the glad day.

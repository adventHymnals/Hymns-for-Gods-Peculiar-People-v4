    1. And when the last loud trumpet
    Shall rend the vaulted skies,
    And bid the entomb'd millions
    From their cold beds arise,
    Our ransom'd dust, revived,
    Bright beauties shall put on,
    And soar to the blest mansions
    Where our Redeemer's gone.

    2. Our eyes shall then, with rapture,
    The Saviour's face behold!
    Our feet, no more diverted,
    Shall walk the street of gold!Our ears shall hear with transport
    The hosts celestial sing!
    Our tongues shall chant the glory
    Of our immortal King.

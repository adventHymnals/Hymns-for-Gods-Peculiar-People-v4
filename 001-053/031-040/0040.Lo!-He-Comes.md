[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dxjHviFWEQ_YRky5Ngc8VJS8QsMtzE1W/edit?mode=html)



    1. Lo! He comes, with clouds descending,
    Once for favor'd sinners slain,
    Thousand, thousand angels shouting
    Swell the triumph of His train;
    Hallelujah! Jesus comes, and comes to reign;
    Hallelujah! Jesus comes, and comes to reign.

    2. Every eye shall now behold Him,
    Rob'd in dreadful majesty!Those who set at nought and sold Him,
    Pierc'd, and nail'd Him to the tree,
    Deeply wailing,
    Shall the true Messiah see!

    3. When the solemn trump has sounded,
    Heaven and earth shall flee away;
    All who hate Him must, confounded,
    Hear the summons of that day—
    Come to judgement!
    Come to judgement! Come away!

    4. Yea, amen! Let all adore Thee,
    High on Thy eternal throne!
    Saviour, take the power and glory,
    Make thy righteous sentence known,
    O come quickly—
    Claim the kingdom for thine own !

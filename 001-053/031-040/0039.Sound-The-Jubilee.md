[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eBCtr16wU4C4ImHm9dONnQOpyB0_qd9Q/edit?mode=html)



    1. While I was down in Egypt's land,
    I heard my Saviour was at hand;
    And the midnight cry was sounding,
    And I wanted to be free;
    So I left my former brethren,
    To sound the Jubilee.

    2. Though opposition waxes strong,
    Yet still the battle won't be long,
    For our blessed Lord is coming;
    He will set the captives free;
    Still keep up good courage, brethren,
    And sound the Jubilee.

    3. The battle is not to the strong,
    The weak may sing the conqueror's song;
    Then lift lip your heads rejoicing,
    Who are glad our Lord to see;
    Bless the Lord, our souls are happy,
    While we sound the Jubilee.

    4. A little longer here below,
    Then home to glory we shall go, I believe it, I believe it.
    Hallelujah now I see,
    That we soon shall be with Jesus;
    In the glorious Jubilee.

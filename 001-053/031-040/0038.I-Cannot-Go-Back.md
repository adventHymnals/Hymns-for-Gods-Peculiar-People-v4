    1. For Canaan I've started, and on I must go,
    Till all the bright glories of Eden I know;
    I've made no reserve, and I'm sure I'll not lack,
    While onward I journey and do not draw back.

    2 My soul is enkindled with rapture and love,

    1 fain would ascend to my Jesus above;
    But nay, I must follow in his humble track,
    And prove my obedience by not drawing back.

    3. Then on let us press, for Jesus is near,
    And strengthen each other with words of good cheer;
    With zeal ever buoyant and courage ne'er slack,
    Let's be true to our King and never draw back.

    1. Soldiers of Christ arise,
    And put your armor on;
    Fight. for the battle will be ours
    We fight to win a crown.

    2. We fight not against flesh;
    We wrestle not with blood;
    But principalities and pow'rs,
    And for the truth of God.

    3. With wicked spirits too,
    That on high places stand,
    Perverting oft the word of God,
    And say 'tis by command.

    4. Put all the armor on
    Like valiant soldiers standâ€”Let all your loins be girt with truth,
    Waiting our Lord's command.

    5. While Jesus is our Friend,
    The Spirit is our guide,
    Well march like valiant soldiers on;
    We're sure to win the prize.

    6. The battle's almost o'er;
    The race is nearly run;
    Then, with our glorious conq'ring King,
    We'll sit down on his throne.

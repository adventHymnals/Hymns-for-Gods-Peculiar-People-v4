[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eUaMZ7pMmpZ6%2Dfur4L_%2DCw0r0JuTW0ow/edit?mode=html)



    1. Jesus, I my cross have taken,
    All to leave and follow thee;
    All things else I have forsaken;
    Thou from hence my all shalt be.
    Perish every fond ambition,
    All I've sought, or hop'd, or known;
    Yet how rich is my condition,
    While I prove the Lord my own.

    2. Let the world despise and leave me,
    They have left my Saviour too;
    Human hearts and looks deceive me,
    Thou art faithful, thou art true.
    O, 'tis not in grief to harm me,
    While thy love is left to me;

    0,'t were not in joy to charm me,
    If that love be hid from me.

    3. Haste thee on from grace to glory,
    Arm'd by faith, and wing'd by pray’r;
    Heaven's eternal day’s before thee;
    God's own hand shall guide thee there
    Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
    Soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;
    Hope shall change to glad fruition,
    Faith to sight, and prayer to praise!

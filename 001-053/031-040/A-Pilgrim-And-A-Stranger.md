[edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eBLSp93iB5VCmUiJK4M4OY3gJW9CKllL/edit?mode=html)



    1. I'm a pilgrim and I'm a stranger;
    I can tarry, I can tarry, but a night;
    Do not detain me, for I am going
    To where the fountains are ever flowing,
    Iâ€™m a pilgrim and I'm a stranger, &c.

    2. There the glory is ever shining!

    0, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;
    Here in this country so dark and dreary,
    I long have wander'd forlorn and weary.
    I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger, &c.

    3. There's the city to which I journey;
    My Redeemer, my Redeemer is its light!
    There is no sorrow, nor any sighing,
    Nor any tears there, nor any dying!
    I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger, &c.

    4. Farewell, dreary earth, by sin so blighted,
    In immortal beauty soon you'll be arrayed!
    He who has form'd thee, will soon restore thee!
    And then thy dread curse shall never more be
    I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger,
    Till thy rest shall end the weary pilgrim's night.
